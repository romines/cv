      <h2>About</h2>
      <h3>In search of great web teams, products.</h3>
      <div class="expandable">
        <p>I am motivated by people and product. By building things that need to exist. By the moment when design and execution align in perfect service of addressing a user need and it just <em>feels right</em>. I am relentless in pursuit of such product wins, but I also do my best to ensure code written in the process reflects my values: reliability, clarity of intent, grace and pragmatism (in equal measure).

          <p class="more hide">Having worked in and around technology for years, and led technical teams, I knew there was a limit to how far I could go as a
non-engineer. In 2015 I took advantage of an immersive web development bootcamp to retrain. Since then I have had the immense pleasure of collaborating on all phases of planning and building complex web applications with a leading provider of resort operations software, as well as developing a variety of business facing web applications independently. My goal is to apply this experience, along with my instincts for product and strategy, to people-focused challenges in technology.<span class="more-link">less</span></p> -->

Unsatisfied with the options available at the time (primarily Angular 1), for better or worse, Vert decided to roll their own JavaScript SPA framework. I have come around to the idea that working with this custom framework has been a great experience for me. It means that core functionality is not just a black box, and existing abstractions can be unpacked, questioned, refactored if necessary.<span class="more-link">less</span></p>
